# A SIMPLE WEATHER APP

Just download the app and run on local server :)

Also goto `js/index.js` and put your API Key there

This app uses [WeatherApi](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch the Weather data and weather icons are also provided by [WeatherApi]((https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/))
